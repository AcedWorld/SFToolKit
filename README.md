This Tool-Kit will be updated with all the changeable options that I can find in the game.
Some features won't change much that you can see in the game.
I still need to go through and work out what is useful and what is not.
So far I have seen that you can have super speed, super jump and do tricks faster.
I will make another menu in the future that only has useful options that are easier to use.
Message me if you discover anything really cool that you can do with certain settings applied.

Installation guide below.

### Step 9
Start the game ScooterFlow from your steam libary.
When the game is loading you should see the UnityModManager in-game menu open.
You can use Ctrl+F10 to open and close.
Make sure the status is a green circle.
If there in an "Available Update" ico you need to open UnityModManager.exe and do an update for the SFToolKit mod then restart the ScooterFlow game.

### Step 10
Once you're on a map you can open the SFToolKit from the top left of the screen.
Opening it on the ScooterFlow main menu will say a lot of things are not found until you load into a map.
